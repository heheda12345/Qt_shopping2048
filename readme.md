# Shopping2048

​	Shopping2048 is a 2048 game to celebrate shopping's 18th birthday. The background of the blocks and the award for getting 2048 are shopping's strange personal photos taken in the third year of our high school. Plus, you can click the flowers in the background to find some in-jokes.

## Getting Started

​	To protect shopping's right of portrait, I removed the photos from the project. Therefore, you need to provide the following pictures in the `source/` folder before running.

```
2048_1.jpg, 2048_2.jpg, ... 2048_15.jpg // background of the blocks
photo_1.png, photo_2.png ... photo_7.png and photo_8.png // award
```

​	For detail, please refer to `*.qrc` files.
